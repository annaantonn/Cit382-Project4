# Cit382-Project4

This project involves generating random integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) using a button. Each randomly generated number is added in sorted order to an array using the useState() React hook function. As each random integer is added to the state, the list of integers is displayed, and statistical information about the list is displayed.
